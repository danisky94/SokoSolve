## May 2020: C19 updates
After a very intense run at performance (topping 64GB memory and 500mil nodes), I realised something was not right. There were
no bugs but the search tree just seemed to balloon around 20+ depth. After a lot of digging and head-scratching, I came to the
assumption that the tree as NOT thread-safe and duplicates were causing the tree to explode (like quantum many-worlds :-} ).

After a week of very intense effort, it defeated me and a stopped working on the project.

Essentially, the single-threaded depth tree should like identical to the many-threaded tree. It did not.

## June 2020: I would like to get back into the code..

But where to start?
