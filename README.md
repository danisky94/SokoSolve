# SokoSolve
Sokoban puzzle game and solver

The origonal project was started and hosted at http://sokosolve.sourceforge.net/, code: https://sourceforge.net/projects/sokosolve/

It was moved to github at a much later date and the C# code updated, however the GUI client has not been ported over.

## Getting Started

```
C:\Projects\SokoSolve\src\SokoSolve.Tests\> dotnet build
C:\Projects\SokoSolve\src\SokoSolve.Tests\> dotnet test
```

## Game

TODO: I have not ported over the GUI or Console game client from the old source-forge repo.

## Solver

TODO: I have not ported over the GUI or command-line solver client old source-forge repo.

## Library

The origonal code used a SQL database for most internal testing. This has been removed, as I don't want any external dependancies.
